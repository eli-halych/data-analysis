    "- [ ] Clustering Algorithms: Use unsupervised learning techniques such as K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering to group customers based on their demographic features. This can help identify distinct customer segments and reveal patterns in spending behavior or credit usage.\n",
    "- [ ] Decision Trees: Build a decision tree model to identify the most important demographic features influencing customer behavior or to predict customer churn based on demographic data.\n",
    "- [ ] Association Rule Learning: Apply algorithms like Apriori or Eclat to identify relationships between demographic features and spending behavior, which can be useful in understanding customer preferences and designing targeted marketing campaigns.\n",
    "- [ ] Classification Models: Train classification models like logistic regression, support vector machines, or random forests to predict customer churn or other behavior-based outcomes using demographic data.\n",
